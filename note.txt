to send a event handler to the parent componet:(সালা ইভেন্ট ফায়ার করবো চাইল্ডে, হ্যান্ডেল করবে প্যারেন্টে! )
1. we have to write the eventHandler function on the parent Component
2. pass that function through props to the child Component
3. on the event on the child Component, we will call the function(that we got from props, written in the parent component)
4. the function will work as if it is written on the child component. this way we can send event data to the parent component. 

on parent component:
    const funcName = () =>{
        // code goes here
    }

    return (
        <Child funcName={funcName} />
    )

on child Component:
    return(
        <button onEvent={props.funcName}></button>
    )

we can add parameters on that function using caller function;(this way we can send data from a child component to its parent component)
